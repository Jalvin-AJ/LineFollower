# LineFollower
An Arduino based Line-Follower bot
As part of our team project, we developed a Line Follower Robot using Arduino for TESLA, the college fest organized by the Electrical Department. The project showcased our practical application of embedded systems, sensor integration, and robotics, combining teamwork and innovation to bring an autonomous navigation system to life.
